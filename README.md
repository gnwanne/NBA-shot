# NBA Shot Logs & Stats Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes NBA shot logs to uncover player shooting performance, shot location patterns, and team scoring efficiency. Using shot-level data, we explore how individual players and teams perform across games and identify insights that can inform coaching and fan analysis.

## Dataset  
Data sourced from [NBA Shot Logs & Stats on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball), containing detailed shot data including player names, shot locations, results, and game context.

## Tools  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis  
- Player shooting percentages (filtered by minimum shot attempts)  
- Shot location visualization for individual players  
- Team average points per game and scoring patterns

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `basketball.csv` in the repo folder  
3. Open and run `nba_shot_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Insights  
- Top shooters by accuracy and shot volume identified  
- Heatmaps highlight shooting hotspots and effectiveness for selected players  
- Team scoring averages provide context on offensive efficiency

## Next Steps  
- Integrate advanced metrics like shot difficulty or defender distance  
- Build interactive dashboards with Plotly or Tableau  
- Expand analysis to include player comparisons across seasons
